// to see ansible modules 
	ansible-doc -l
// to see specific module 
	ansible-doc yum 
// displaying output in one line 
	ansible all -m ping -o
	
// in order to add local host into ansible host file means 

1) copy the ssh-id 
	ssh-copy-id ansible@localhost
	
2) then try to connect 
	ansible all -m ping 
	
3) in order to install a package in all target server 
	1) ansible all -b -m yum -a "name=vim"
		OR
	   ansible all -b -m yum -a "name=vim state=present"
	   
	2) ansible all -b -m yum -a "name=httpd state=present"  // to install 
	
	   ansible all -b -m service -a "name=vim state=started"  	//  to start httpd
	   ansible all -b -m service -a "name=vim state=stopped"  	//  to stop httpd
	   ansible all -b -m service -a "name=vim state=restarted"  	//  to restart httpd
	   
	   ansible all -b -m yum -a "name=vim state=absent"	// to uninstall the httpd
	   		OR
	   ansible all -b -m yum -a "name=vim state=removed"	// to uninstall the httpd
	   
	
4) other commands to know details of server
	ansible all -b -m shell -a "uptime" 
	ansible all -b -m shell -a "date"
	ansible all -b -m shell -a "cat /etc/*release"
	ansible all -b -m shell -a "uname"
	ansible all -b -m shell -a "df -h"
	
5) NOTE: a command will get executed when you hit without double quotes an argument without option 
Ex: 	ansible all -b -m shell -a df 
	ansible all -b -m shell -a date
	
   but when you enter a command a with option then you need to use double quotes for an argument 
Ex: 	ansible all -b -m shell -a "df -h"
	ansible all -b -m yum -a "name=vim"
	
6) Copy a file from source to destination 
	ansible all -m service -a "src=test.txt dest=/tmp/test.txt 
	
7) to get server details or facts of server information 
	ansible localhost -m setup
	
8) You can segregate groups as mentioned below and call 
Ex: [webservers]
    192.168.0.0
    192.168.0.1
    192.168.0.2
    
    [appservers]
    192.168.0.3
    192.168.0.4
    192.168.0.5
    
    ansible webservers -m ping 
    ansible appservers -m ping
    
9) you can create custom ansible host file and call 
    sudo vi /etc/ansible/facebook
    192.168.0.0                          // add the ip 
    :wq
    
    ansible -i /etc/ansible/facebook all -m ping
    
10) you can set a custom host file as parmanent using environment variable but ansible will not recommend to create 

    export ANSIBLE_HOSTS=/etc/ansible/amazon
    

NOTE: before running the playbook verify the indentation whether written script is correct or not by using below command and once dry run 
	1) syntax check command 
		ansible-playbook pingserver.yml --syntax-check
	2) Dry run 
		ansible-playbook pingserver.yml --check
		
	3) to know ansible commands with options 
		ansible-playbook --help
